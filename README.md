# Introduction to Stratego:
Stratego is a two-player board game that simulates a battlefield where players command armies of varying ranks. 
The goal of every player is to get the other's player flag. 
In this case, this is not a regular Stratego. this is Stratego Marvel, so the winner is the one who get's the Infinity Glove of the other player.
